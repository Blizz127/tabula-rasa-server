# New character to endgame preservation order

The user's 2026-09-12 instruction establishes this implementation order for the
final live Tabula Rasa preservation target. This is an ordered work record;
none of the segments below is currently certified as complete or 1:1.

| Order | Playable segment | Required behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — current | Creation and first login | Family/character names, allowed appearance/races, initial inventory and equipment, training/point state, starting location, first-login and boot-camp options, persistence |
| 2 | Final live boot camp | Original mission/NPC sequence, tutorial events, combat and equipment use, Logos acquisition, rewards, failure/retry behavior, exit and supported skip path |
| 3 | Wilderness and first class advancement | Early missions and encounters, loot/economy, leveling and training, level-5 class choice, clone workflow, travel and instance progression |
| 4 | Tier-two progression to level 15 | Both branches, original missions/regions/instances, inherited and new abilities, level-15 advancement and cloning |
| 5 | Tier-three progression to level 30 | All four branches and their content, progression dependencies, level-30 advancement, signatures and cloning |
| 6 | Tier-four progression to level 50 | All eight final classes, original late leveling content, gear, crafting, groups and required regional/system progression |
| 7 | Endgame and shutdown live state | Final instances, encounters, equipment and rewards, control points/PvP/social systems, final deployed content and documented final events |

Where original server data is permanently lost, the user's 2026-09-13
decision applies: reconstruct from footage, the original map and client data,
labelling every estimated value with its provenance tier, source and
uncertainty (see `AGENTS.md`). The boot camp is the first segment built this way.

Within each segment, recover original data and observable behavior, implement
the required server flow, and verify creation/interaction/reconnect and failure
paths. Shared systems belong to the earliest segment that needs them. Working
unit tests establish software behavior; original artifacts and gameplay
comparison establish fidelity. Do not skip unresolved early progression by
substituting invented rewards, unrestricted gear or debug advancement.

Use static analysis of the recovered versioned client, archived official
material, contemporary direct gameplay footage/guides, and other emulator
source. Record source versions, exact locations or video timestamps, confidence
and conflicts. Keep acquired client/video artifacts and private character data
outside Git. An older guide or emulator's default is not by itself proof of
the final-live rule.

## Current creation findings

- Dated post-rewrite evidence establishes all five Recruit skills at rank 1
  with zero initial unspent points. Creation now persists these ranks together
  with the character and items in one transaction, with failure rollback.
- The starter pistol now receives durability from its own template.
- The first-family six-field creation message now has a handler, with the
  original `None` family state and persisted admission/replay checks.
- Fixed Recruit outfit colors match the original creation preview. Selection
  now checks the original two-field message, rejects overflowing slot values,
  and preserves session selection when ownership lookup or saving fails.
- The full initial inventory/placement, race and appearance eligibility,
  starting point, and first-login/skip state remain under reconstruction.
- Deployment 11 rebuilt boot camp. The archived Bootcamp page marks its own
  mission list obsolete; recover the later sequence before importing missions.
- The recovered later client identifies missions 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995 and
  the retry 2005, 21 objectives and ten NPC dialogue bindings. The current
  boot-camp map has no spawn-pool rows or mission definitions; start/reward/skip
  scripts remain unrecovered. See [the boot-camp audit](bootcamp-client-evidence.md).
- A verified 2026-09-13 sweep established that the original static map holds
  no gameplay actors at all, so first-login position, NPC placements and
  objects must come from captures or observation, not client data.
- The server now speaks the recovered mission-log and NPC objective
  conversation protocol with persistent per-character progress, which the
  tutorial's conversation objectives require. No tutorial content is loaded;
  incomplete definitions are withheld. See
  [mission research](mission-research.md#mission-log-protocol-and-persistence--2026-09-13).

- Three original recordings, the main one dated by player chat to the final week before shutdown,
  were transcribed, independently verified and matched against the client radar maps. They give
  measured positions for the arrival point, the Initiation trigger areas and the first NPCs and
  objects, and the observed rewards of the first missions. See
  [verified footage](bootcamp-client-evidence.md#2026-09-13-verified-footage-what-three-original-recordings-establish).
- The server has the data layer for labelled reconstruction (S0 of the boot-camp build plan): content
  rows are validated and withheld unless every mechanic they need exists, and a new-character entry
  switch defaults to the Wilderness start. No boot-camp content is seeded yet; the owner decisions for the
  first slice are recorded below.

## S1 (Initiation) status

- The S1 mechanism is implemented and committed (`3443cd6`): the mission-content runtime (rules,
  conditions, area sweeps, radio offers, forced greetings, tutorials, Logos grants and stationary
  creature placement) plus the packets and hooks it needs. `MissionContentRules.Implemented` now
  declares exactly the S1 mechanics and the entry path reads as implemented, still gated by
  `Bootcamp.EntryMode` (default `Disabled`). No boot-camp rows are seeded, so every hook is a runtime
  no-op; the full suite (756 tests) passes.
- S1 positions are recovered in `docs/evidence/bootcamp-d11-positions.json`: `spawn.first_login`,
  `area.1990.1`, `area.1990.2` and `npc.mcallister`. X,Z are the verified-footage radar measurements;
  Y is read from the decoded `adv_bootcamp` map heightmap (`t000007c1_terrain.glm`, context 1985),
  whose decode reproduces a static prop base to 0.03 m. Each record carries its tier, uncertainty,
  method and frames. `area.1990.2` uses the measured objective-2 marker because the build plan's
  `ArchElohHologramPlatformLarge` anchor sits by the far Eloh hologram; the discrepancy is recorded
  in the record.
- The twenty-one footage events the S1 rows cite are extracted (with verifier corrections applied) into
  `docs/evidence/bootcamp-d11-footage-events.json` from the A1/A2/A3 transcripts and verifications.
- The S1 content is seeded by the `BootcampS1Initiation` data migration (SQLite and MySQL, generated with
  `dotnet-ef 5.0.1`, parity-checked) from `src/Rasa.DBL/Migrations/BootcampData/BootcampS1InitiationRows.cs`:
  the start location, McAllister, mission 1990 with its objectives, transition and rewards, the two
  objective areas and bindings, the four rules and five actions, and the placement. The 23 manifest rows
  record every value's tier and citation. OD-11 resolved McAllister's unrecoverable `class_id` and
  `max_hp` as labelled analogues (entity class 3846 `NPC_Human_Swapset_Male`, the class the world data
  uses for AFS human commanders; 1000 hp at level 10). The full suite (777 tests) passes.
- Remaining S1 verification: deploy the candidate, set `Bootcamp.EntryMode`, and run the owner client
  check against the footage; the planned `ReconstructionSeedTests`, `PositionFileTests`,
  `ReconstructionDefinitionTests` and `SliceReadinessReport` are not written yet.

## Boot-camp owner decisions

The user decided these open points of the boot-camp build plan on 2026-09-13, after the S0
deployment. They are recorded as approved decisions in
`docs/evidence/bootcamp-d11-reconstruction-manifest.json`, and every value that depends on them keeps
its evidence tier.

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| OD-4 Power Logos (Lightning) | Silent `LogosStoneTabula` grant of Logos 23 when Initiation objective 1 completes, with greeting 1634 (inferred: no Logos chat line in the footage; the client binds its Lightning tutorial to greeting 1634) |
| OD-1 Entry rollout | All new characters enter the boot camp once Initiation (S1) is ready, even before the later missions and the exit exist |
| OD-3 Radial Menu tip 10000018 | Included on Initiation acceptance (observed id, inferred binding) |
| OD-11 NPC classes | Labelled final-live analogue classes where the class id is unrecoverable; names, levels and positions stay evidence-based |
| OD-2, 5–10, 12, 13, 15–18 (approved 2026-09-14) | The build plan's recommended defaults: per-character boot-camp instances with monotonic ids and separate squad instances; wall-clock objective timers with a labelled 600 s analogue for 1995; Youngblood gives retry 2005; exit pad at the damaged-pad map entity, and the exit sets `can_skip_bootcamp`; crate and second practice dummy by labelled match; the instance owner is credited for any kill of a bound placement; labelled final-live analogues for Tizzik Gi, the wreck, bomb, corpse and wounded soldier; no invented protection for mission NPCs. OD-14 (creation loadout correction) is still open. |
